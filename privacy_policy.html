        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What we are</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">We want to depict the life of every location across the world as it happens. We are pursuing this vision by creating a platform where users are not people but locations. You become the location in which you are right now. Speaking for the location &ndash; You represent it on the world map and make it come to life. The responsibility lies with the community to maintain a healthy feed. Our motto &ndash; Be constructive, Be effective.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Report</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Pole aspires to create a free and fair platform to represent a location. You can do your bit to keep your location feed clean. Report a spark/reply citing the reason. Our team shall review it. If content is found abusive, derogatory or malicious to a person or community - It shall be removed.The user reputation shall be penalized and account deactivated on repeated occurrences. Content you report from a Pole feed will be hidden from your feed immediately. However, Pole may maintain a copy of the content in our records. Mail us at spark@poletalks.com for any further reason/concern that might be mentioned in the report button.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Profile</strong></p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Each user maintains his profile which has the sparks poled by him/her and the associated reputation points. This profile shows the credibility of the content you Pole and your reputation determines your visibility in the location feed algorithm.The reason a user cannot delete his/her spark is to deter people from spamming.</p>
